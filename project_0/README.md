### What needs to be done    
Need to write a program that guesses a number for the minimum number of tries

**Conditions:**  
- The computer guesses an integer from 0 to 100, and we have to guess it. By “guess”, we mean “write a program that guesses the number”.
- The algorithm considers information about whether a random number is greater than or less than the number we need.

**Quality metric**
  
Results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions

**What practice**     
- to write good code on python
- to work with git
- to work with vs code


### Results:  
Based on the given criteria, a halving algorithm was used. For the interval of numbers from 0 to 100 the function guesses the number on average for 5 attempts.
